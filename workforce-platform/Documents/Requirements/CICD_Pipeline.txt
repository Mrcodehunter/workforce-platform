CI/CD Pipeline
Set up a CI/CD pipeline that runs on every push to the main branch. You choose the CI platform.

1. Minimum Pipeline Stages
2. Build — Compile and build all services (backend, frontend, workers).
3. Test — Run any automated tests.
4. Lint / Static Analysis — Run linters for both frontend and backend.
5. Docker Build — Build all Docker images to verify they compile correctly.

The pipeline must pass on the main branch. Include a status badge in your README.
