Frontend (React + TypeScript)
Build a **single-page applicatio**n using React with TypeScript. You can use JavaScript only if run into issue or un familiar with TypeScript (Must document your reason). You must use a modern UI component/design library—choose one and use it consistently throughout the application. The frontend must be responsive and handle loading, empty, and error states properly.

The frontend is a separate project from the backend, served by its own container.


**Employee Management Views
1. Employee List: A paginated data grid showing core employee information. Must support search, filtering by department and active status, and column sorting. Each row links to a detail view.

2. Employee Detail: A composite view that pulls data from multiple sources. It must display the employee’s profile information and assigned projects (from SQL), their leave request history (from MongoDB), and an audit trail of changes made to this employee (from MongoDB). This page also supports editing employee information and deleting (soft-delete) the record. Provide clear navigation back to the list.

3. Create Employee: A form with proper validation for all required fields. Must include a multi-value input for skills (add/remove tags).

**Project & Task Views
1. Project List: An overview of all projects with status, team size, and progress indication. Must support creating new projects.

2. Project Detail & Task Board: Displays project information and its team members. Tasks are displayed in a view that represents their workflow states (the specific UI pattern is your choice). Users must be able to create tasks, assign them to team members, and transition task status. This view should make the current state of the project immediately understandable at a glance.


**Leave Management Views
1. Leave Request List: Shows all leave requests with their current approval status. Must support filtering by status and leave type. Each entry’s embedded approval history should be viewable without navigating away.

2. Submit Leave Request: A form with date range selection, leave type choice, and validation (e.g., end date must be after start date). On submission, a domain event is published.

3. Approve / Reject Flow: An interface for reviewing pending requests and recording approval decisions with optional comments. Each action adds an entry to the embedded approval history in MongoDB.

**Dashboard & Reports
A dashboard page that displays the summary report generated by the scheduled background worker. This view must present data originating from both databases—for example, department headcount and project stats from SQL alongside leave analytics and recent system activity from MongoDB. The specific visualizations and charts you use are your choice.

**Audit Trail
Audit data should be surfaced in at least two places: within entity detail pages (scoped to that entity) and as a standalone activity feed or log page showing recent system-wide activity.
