Deliverables
1. A public GitHub repository.
2. Commit history showing incremental progress with meaningful commit messages—not a single giant commit.
3. A working Docker Compose setup: docker compose up --build must bring up the entire system.
4. A passing CI/CD pipeline with a status badge in the README.
5. An AI-WORKFLOW.md documenting your AI-assisted development process.
6. A comprehensive README including: project overview, architecture diagram (Mermaid, draw.io, or image), setup instructions, environment variables, justification for every major technology choice, and known limitations.
