Docker & Infrastructure
The entire stack must be orchestrated with Docker Compose. Your compose file should define at minimum the following containers:

1. API Server (.NET 10)
2. Frontend (React, served via a web server or dev server)
3. SQL Database (your choice)
4. MongoDB
5. Message Broker (your choice)
6. Background Worker 1 (.NET)
7. Background Worker 2 (Node.js)

Expectations
1. All services must start with: docker compose up --build
2. Use multi-stage Dockerfiles to minimize image sizes.
3. All configuration (connection strings, broker URLs, ports) must be via environment variables—no hardcoded secrets or connection strings in code.
4. Proper health checks and startup dependency ordering.
5. Volumes for database persistence during development.
