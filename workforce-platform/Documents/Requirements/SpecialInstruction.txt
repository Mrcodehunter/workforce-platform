Keep frontend and backend in separate directories within the same monorepo.
Use functional React components with hooks.
Handle errors gracefully on both frontend and backend.
Use structured logging in all backend services.
Document every third-party library and your reason for choosing it.
If something is incomplete, document what you would do given more time in a KNOWN-ISSUES.md or the README.
Write clean, readable code. We read every file.
You can skip or choose to submit partial implementation if you get stuck on something. We will evaluate your effort accordingly. We encourage you learn, adapt and try.
