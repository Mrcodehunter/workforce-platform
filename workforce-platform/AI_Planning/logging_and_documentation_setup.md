# AI Planning: Logging and Documentation Setup

## Date: February 8, 2026

## Objective
Establish structured logging and documentation system for AI-assisted development sessions.

## Requirements
1. Log all AI interactions in `AI_Interaction_History` folder
2. Store planning documents in `AI_Planning` folder
3. Maintain chronological history of development decisions
4. Track problem-solving processes and solutions

## Folder Structure

```
workforce-platform/
├── AI_Interaction_History/
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD_session.md          # Daily session logs
│   └── interaction_summary.md          # Summary of all interactions
├── AI_Planning/
│   ├── architecture_decisions.md      # Architecture planning
│   ├── migration_plans.md             # Migration planning
│   └── feature_planning.md            # Feature development planning
```

## Logging Format

### Session Logs
Each session log should include:
- Date and time
- Issues encountered
- Problems identified
- Solutions applied
- Files modified/created
- Current project status
- Notes and observations

### Planning Documents
Planning documents should include:
- Objective/Goal
- Current state analysis
- Proposed approach
- Implementation steps
- Risks and considerations
- Success criteria

## Implementation Status
✅ Folders created
✅ Initial session log created
✅ Planning document structure established

## Next Steps
- Continue logging all future AI interactions
- Create planning documents for major features/changes
- Maintain chronological history
- Review and update documentation as project evolves
